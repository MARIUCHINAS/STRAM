## What does the STRAM do?
It is a steam workshop downloader that download stuff.

## Which games are supported for anonymous downloads and which ones do you need to own?
List of supported games for anonymous download: https://steamdb.info/sub/17906/apps/

## Don't tools that do this already exist?
Yes they do. I made STRAM for personal use and to learn not to invent something new.

## How do i get the Game/Workshop ID?
### Workshop ID
Its pretty simple when you find the asset you want to download get its url and extract the workshop id from it so for example if you want to download this asset: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3004124307 the the Worksop id would be 3004124307
### Game ID
For the game id its a little difrent but the same principle just go onto the workshop page for the game you are getting the asset for and get the link: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1118200/workshop/
so for this one the game id would be 1118200
For getting game id's you can also use this site: https://steamdb.info/sub/17906/apps/

# What else do i need to know?
When you first lauch the app it will ask you to install steamcmd and take you to the download just once the zip file has downloaded unzip it using "Extract files" then put the resulting folder in the STRAM directory
